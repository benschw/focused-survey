		<h1>Focused Serveys</h1>
		<p>
			<em>Focused Survey</em> combines the functions of an open-ended focus group 
			and a closed-ended survey in a single, easily administered, 
			automated process.  Like other survey tools, Focused Survey will 
			be useful for anyone who wishes to gather opinion on a topic e.g. a 
			teacher asking her students to evaluate her course, a city council 
			gathering public opinion on a policy question, the manufacturer of 
			a new product seeking consumer feedback, etc.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Step 1</dt> 
			<dd>
				The administrator poses a question and identifies the survey population.
			</dd>
	
			<dt>Step 2</dt>
			<dd>
				"Phase 1" is launched at a time specified by the administrator.  
				This is the open-ended, focus group segment.  At this point, 
				respondents are invited to write short comments in response to the 
				question posed by the administrator.  Respondents can see the 
				comments of other participants in real time, making it possible 
				for them to raise new points, to disagree, etc.
			</dd>
	
			<dt>Step 3</dt>
			<dd>
				"Phase 2" is launched at the time designated by the administrator. 
				This is the closed-ended survey segment.  At this point, the same 
				group of respondents logs back in to see the short comments they 
				entered in Phase 1 listed in a closed-ended format, inviting them 
				to respond to each on a scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly 
				disagree."  The administrator has the option of limiting this 
				survey to items submitted by respondents in Phase 1 or of adding 
				additional items to the Phase 2 survey.
			</dd>
	
			<dt>Step 4</dt>
			<dd>
				After the survey in completed, the administrator can obtain statistical reports.
